# RiskBot
This repository is for [SYNCS Bot Battle 2024](https://syncs.org.au/competition), an event that every player need to build a bot to play board game "Risk" with the [game engine](https://github.com/syncs-usyd/risk-game-engine) and fight each other. We propose a bot that can interact with this engine and compete with other bot /players.
