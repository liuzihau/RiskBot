# RiskBot
This repository is for [SYNCS Bot Battle 2024](https://syncs.org.au/competition), an event that every player need to build a bot that can play a board game "Risk" with the [game engine](https://github.com/syncs-usyd/risk-game-engine) and fight each other. We propose a bot that can interact with this engine and compete with other bot /players.  
### Structure
``` /old version ```  
Tracks all the bots that had been submited during this competition  
``` /developing_version ```  
Put the bots are still under testing / haven't full implemented some idea.  
``` bot.py ```  
This is the final submitted version.
